# Temperature-monitoring-system
Temperature monitoring system developed in Contiki using two Z1-mote (Unicast Communication) and Plotly API  

This project was developed using Contiki OSâ€™s  RPL protocol for network connection. Both the sender and receiver program was written using C programming language. The complete project was done my modifying the example code files for temperature sensor, unicast sender and unicast receiver available in Contiki OS. For implementing the receiver node as a boarder router a python script was written to read the serial data and to feed that data to the plotly web server.
